# Aim and Objectives
# Aim
 The main aim of the project is to design and implement the mathematical operation by using matrices.
# Objectives 
  The main objectives includes:
   * understand the concept of matrices.
   * know how to perform some simple operation such as addition , mutliplication.
# benefits
 * Less memory band width.
 * Easier to manipulate (Aleast in c,no need for matrix manipulation function.)
 * Improve collabration flexbility.
 
# 4 W's and 1H
# What
  * we use matrices to list data or represent system.
# When 
  * when user wants to Add,Multiply,Square .
# Where
  * when user wants to Add,Multiply,Square anywhere else.
# Who
  * people use matrices to list data or represent system.
# How
  * If we enter your choice particular operation will be done.
# SWOT Analysis
 # Strength
  * To improve their capability to run global or regional projects and system.
  * To improve access to resources,skill and technologies.
  * To bring flexbility through faster decision.
# Weakness
  * Accountabilities and authority can be less clear and are often shared.
  * More people become involved in the decision process, which can slow things down.
  * Ambiguity increase with competing goals and higher levels of change and flexibility.
