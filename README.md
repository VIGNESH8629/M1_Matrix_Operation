# Description
Matrix operations mainly involve three algebraic operations which are addition of matrices, square of matrices , and multiplication of matrices. Matrix is a rectangular array of numbers or expressions arranged in rows and columns. Important applications of matrices can be found in mathematics.
# Addition
If two matrices have the same dimensions, they may be added together.
# Multiplication
If two matrices have the same dimensions, they may be added together.matrix multiplication is a binary operation that produces a matrix from two matrices.
# Square
A square matrix is a matrix with the same number of rows and columns. An n-by-n matrix is known as a square matrix of order n. Any two square matrices of the same order can be added and multiplied
